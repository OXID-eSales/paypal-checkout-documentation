   If you choose deferred capture, you must deliver the product within 30 days and complete the transaction or find a solution together with the customer.

   Background: By placing an order, PayPal is initially authorized to collect the money from your customer for 3 days. The authorization is automatically extended up to a maximum of 29 days after ordering.

   After thirty days, the authorization expires, and PayPal can no longer collect the invoice amount.
